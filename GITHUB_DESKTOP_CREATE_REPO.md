# ✅ GitHub Desktop: Create Repository Here

## 🎯 What to Do Now

GitHub Desktop is asking: **"Would you like to create a repository here instead?"**

### ✅ Click "Create a Repository" (or "Yes")

This will create a fresh Git repository in this folder for your new GitHub account.

---

## 📋 Step-by-Step After Clicking "Create"

### Step 1: Repository Settings

After clicking "Create a Repository", you'll see a form. Fill it in:

```
Name: solana-token-creation-bot
Description: Automated Telegram bot for creating Solana SPL tokens and managing listings on Pump.fun, Axiom Trade, and BullX

☐ Initialize this repository with a README (UNCHECKED - we already have README.md)
☐ Git ignore: None (we already have .gitignore)
☐ License: None (we already have LICENSE)
```

**IMPORTANT:** Make sure these are **UNCHECKED** because we already have these files!

### Step 2: Click "Create Repository"

---

### Step 3: Verify Files

After creating, GitHub Desktop will show all files. **Check that these are NOT listed:**
- ❌ `config.json` (should be hidden)
- ❌ `tokens.json` (should be hidden)
- ❌ `wallets.json` (should be hidden)

**Files that SHOULD be listed:**
- ✅ `main.py`
- ✅ `README.md`
- ✅ `LICENSE`
- ✅ `requirements.txt`
- ✅ `config.example.json`
- ✅ `.gitignore`
- ✅ All `.md` files

### Step 4: Make Initial Commit

1. At the bottom left, type commit message:
   ```
   Initial commit: Solana Token Creation Bot
   ```
2. Click **"Commit to main"**

---

### Step 5: Publish to GitHub

1. Click **"Publish repository"** button (top right)

2. Settings:
   ```
   Name: solana-token-creation-bot
   Description: Automated Telegram bot for creating Solana SPL tokens and managing listings on Pump.fun, Axiom Trade, and BullX
   Keep this code private: ☐ UNCHECKED (make it public)
   ```

3. Click **"Publish Repository"**

---

## 🚨 If Sensitive Files Appear

If you see `config.json`, `tokens.json`, or `wallets.json` in the file list:

1. **Right-click** on the file
2. Click **"Ignore"**
3. It will be added to `.gitignore` automatically

---

## ✅ Done!

After publishing, your repository will be live on GitHub!
